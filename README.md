### Day 1 : ✅ part1 ✅ part2
### Day 2 : ✅ part1 ✅ part2
### Day 3 : ✅ part1 ✅ part2
### Day 4 : ✅ part1 ✅ part2
### Day 5 : ❌ part1 ❌ part2
**Learned a new algorithm :** Recursive Binary Search for ranges ([Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18buwiz/comment/kc78ou6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

**Why I failed :** I did not check if the ranges did not overlap, so I tried to map naively 1:1 for each transform list.
### Day 6 : ✅ part1 ✅ part2
### Day 7 : ✅ part1 ✅ part2
### Day 8 : ✅ part1 ❌ part2
**Learned a new algorithm :** LCM ([Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18dfpub/2023_day_8_part_2_why_is_spoiler_correct/) about the reasons it works for this problem)

**Why I failed :** I did not check if the mapping was looping and hence, did not think about any clever way to resolve the second part of this problem.
